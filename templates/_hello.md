# Hi, I'm Adam 👋

> I've been a backend programmer for ~20 years in a variety of different languages before I discovered Python 10 years
ago and never looked back. `alldjango` includes all the hard-won experience I've gained over the years building
production-scale Django websites.

> Feel free to reach out to [me on Mastodon](https://indieweb.social.com/@adamghill) or make a [GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/adamghill/alldjango.com/issues) with questions, comments, or bitter
invectives.
