# Introduction

It feels like Python packaging has changed pretty substantially over the past few years. When I started creating Python packages the preferred approach was with `setup.py` and (what felt like) a myriad of other random files that were needed like `MANIFEST.in`, `setup.cfg`, etc. I basically found a guide once and then copied and pasted files around once I seemed to get something working.

I was an early adopter of [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) with the primary appeal being lock files which promised consistent deployments. My early excitement got me burned multiple times and I looked around some more.

I remember [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org) being the cool, new upstart at the time. It completely eschewed `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, and other disparate files -- it had one `pyproject.toml` file to configure a project, developer-friendly tooling to add dependencies, a lock file for consistent deployments, and an algorithm to make sure that a tree of dependencies was all compatible with each other (which was not possible with that version of `pip` at that time).

I was in love. There were  definite rough patches and there were a few bugs that caught me here or there, but overall `Poetry` has been my go-to for a while.

However, in the past few years, `Python` packaging seems to be going through a new era of innovation. `pip` [released a dependency resolver in 2020](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#changes-to-the-pip-dependency-resolver-in-20-3-2020) that now complains when dependencies conflict. Also in 2020, [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) and [PEP 631](https://peps.python.org/pep-0631/) standardized `pyproject.toml` as the new normal for Python packages instead of `setup.py`. [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) and [PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) created standards for Python build systems.

Based on those PEPs, `Poetry` isn't the only forward-thinking package manager anymore. `pipenv` is still around (and I presume more stable at this point!), but [`Hatch`](https://hatch.pypa.io/), [`PDM`](https://pdm-project.org/), and [`Rye`](https://rye-up.com) all promise a pleasant developer experience when creating Python packages.

# Benefits

Most of the tools investigated are of the "all in one" mentality and provide similar benefits: adding dependencies from the command-line, lock files, building, and publishing packages. [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) lays out the steps necessary to create a `Python` package manually.

Reducing the number of tools required to create new Python packages means there is only one place to look for documentation and keep up to date.

# [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)

My first modern Python package manager. I would say the documentation is still the best available, although it might be too "designed" for some. It does _a lot_ -- maybe too much? -- but, in my opinion, it pioneered a lot of features that are now expected in other Python package managers. I get the feeling it sometimes pushes forward without waiting for official PEPs, although I think that has changed over the past few years.

One annoying feature lacking in `Poetry` that is available in every other option are the ability to define "scripts". For example, `poetry run manage.py runserver 0:8000` is pretty long-winded and it would be useful to just type `poetry run dev`. That is not available in standard `Poetry`, although I use `poethepoet` (a `Poetry` plugin) to provide that functionality.

# [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/)

`Hatch` follows the Python PEP standards and brings a few innovative features to table, including having dependencies and scripts per-environment. The [`hatch new [project]`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/intro/#new-project) command is surprisingly opinionated with standard setup for `ruff` (my new favorite Python tool), `pytest`, and `coverage`. I'm here for all of the tool choices, but I would be lying if I did not say it was a little surprising.

Part of the PyPA organization which probably gives it more sheen of officialdom than other tools.

# [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/)

`PDM` for some reason feels like the sleeper option compared to the rest. I have not used it too much other than set up a new project and play around with it a little bit. It seems to have a lot of the same features, but I would love to hear someone's thoughts who uses it day-in day-out.

# [Rye](https://rye-up.com)

`rye` has had a quick and meteoric rise. It was developed by the creator of Flask, [Armin Ronacher](https://github.com/mitsuhiko) based on his opinionated approach to building `Python` packages. It reminds me of `black` a little bit in which a respected `Python` developer made an opinionated tool and it caught fire in the community.

`Rye` has multiple notes that it is experimental and not production-ready, although I did not see any glaring issues with my simple testing.

One thing that makes `rye` standout from the other options is that it handles Python versions directly -- `Poetry` recommends using `pyenv` to deal with multiple Python environments.

# GitHub Stats

GitHub stats are not particularly useful, but the number of stars do give some indication of the community engagement with a particular tool.

# Conclusions and takeaways

One could look at all of the options for Python packaging and be frustrated by the number of options. I understand that viewpoint, but also I try to appreciate that all of these tools are making different trade-offs. Hopefully in the future there is one "approved" Python package manager, but it will always be useful to have multiple options because people's needs are different, but a particularly good feature in one tool help push the ecosystem forward.

As for me, I have multiple projects using `setup.py` and `Poetry`, one using `Hatch`, and now one using `Rye`. I am going to keep trying new tools to figure out which works the best for me!
