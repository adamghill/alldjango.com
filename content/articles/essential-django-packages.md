Django is sometimes called the batteries-included web framework, but there are a few third-party packages I tend to install for every Django project. I have categorized the packages for different use-cases, although one important note is that I am primarily thinking about side projects and websites with reasonable traffic requirements (i.e. 99% of the websites ever created). I personally have a few sites that have survived the Hacker News home page with most of this stack, so you'll also probably be just fine (and it turns out that judicious use of caching with `redis` can handle _a lot_ of traffic). üòâ

Thanks to Will Vincent for publishing [20 Django Packages That I Use in Every Project](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/20-django-packages-i-use-every-project) which directly inspired this post -- we have a few packages which overlap, but of course there are some differences as well. Also, if you need more awesomeness there is always [awesomedjango.org](https://awesomedjango.org) or... if you want to see the whole breadth of options check out [djangopackages.org](https://djangopackages.org)!

I have linked to the sponsor/donation page for each library with a ‚ù§Ô∏è if I could find it (please let me know if I missed any). One way to support these indispensible libraries is financially -- every 6 months or so, I [document](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill/111720848975106667) what I personally sponsor and I encourage you to as well if it's within your means and budget. Or better yet, get your workplace to sponsor the open source software they rely on!

And finally, just a note: lists like this are inherently subjective -- all libraries have their own trade-offs and nothing is perfect for everyone. I built up this list over years of trying things and seeing what worked for me and what _I_ liked. I humbly suggest you come up with your own list, write it up, and [let me know](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill) -- I'd love to read it and see what packages I'm missing out on!


## Pre-Django

### [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)

I remember maybe 8 years ago when a co-worker tried to convince our team to use `yapf` and I was dead-set against it. I do not remember the actual conversation, just that I thought it was a horrible idea. I probably said something like, "Why would I want something to change my code automatically?!" or "I don't agree with this one formatting rule, therefore it must be bad."

Boy, has my opinion changed. At first, `isort` opened my eyes to the wonder of not manually alphabetizing all of my code imports. Then, `black` came along (with its delightful lack of settings) and I realized that I was now willing to trade "my personal code style" for "never thinking about code formatting ever again". _Especially_ when working in a team where everyone tends to have their "own style".

Then, `ruff` was released and eventually replaced my linter, `black`, _and_ `isort` with lightning fast speed. To be fair, I do not love that `ruff` is built in Rust and that Astral is VC-backed, but 1) it's not like I ever contributed to the Python code bases of any of the tools it replaced, so pretty sure that point is moot (at least for me personally), and 2) the code is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/LICENSE) -- not sure what more I could ask for from the team at Astral.

### [pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/)

I appreciate that Django has unit testing built-in. However, I do not use it because I have completely converted to the church of `pytest`. The lack of required classes is appealing and fixtures are wonderful (even if they are _sometimes_ a little too magical ü™Ñ). I appreciate the fine-grained control over the database, especially [preventing migrations from running](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database.html#no-migrations-disable-django-migrations) and all of the [Django-specific fixtures](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#fixtures).

### [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/)

Integrates `pytest` with `coverage` to tell you how much of your code is covered by unit tests.

## Running in production

These are packages that I always use on production. They are all battle-tested, stable, fast, and [boring technology](https://boringtechnology.club) (in the best possible sense of the phrase).

### [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org)

My go-to WSGI server for production. Extremely stable and when paired with NGINX for static assets it can handle a decent amount of traffic. I have seen benchmarks that other servers might be faster, but `gunicorn` is rock-solid and configuration is simple -- exactly what I'm looking for.

### [Psycopg 2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/) [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/sponsors/dvarrazzo?o=esb)

Django has support for other relational databases, but I switched from MySQL to Postgres a long time ago and never looked back. I wouldn't want to operate any database in production, but especially not Postgres. I suggest finding a cloud provider who has a managed Postgres offering. It's worth it.

[Psycopg 3](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/) is now released, but I have not used it in production... yet.

### [redis](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) + [hiredis](https://pypi.org/project/hiredis/)

`redis` is fast, it's got minimal resource requirements, and it's my go-to cache. As opposed to `PostgreSQL` I do run my own `redis` in production because I treat the data as ephemeral. If my lack of DevOps-fu breaks it, it shouldn't matter.


## Core Django

If I could wave a magic wand, I wish at least a little bit of the functionality of these packages would be incorporated into Django. I (helpfully?) rant about making Django more "batteries-included" in [Django Roadmap 2024](https://dev.to/adamghill/django-roadmap-2024-2ocn#modernize).

### [python-dotenv](https://saurabh-kumar.com/python-dotenv/)

I tend to reach for `python-dotenv` although I have also used `django-environs` for this functionality. There are a bunch out there, but all I really want is a way to load an `.env` file into Django settings (at least in development). Follow [twelve-factor](https://12factor.net/config) and keep secrets out of your code.

### [django-cache-memoize](https://django-cache-memoize.readthedocs.io/)

This is a function decorator that integrates with the core Django cache. There are a lot of cache decorator libraries floating around, but I have run into a few gotchas with them. `django-cache-memoize` works exactly as expected.

### [django-model-utils](https://django-model-utils.readthedocs.io/) [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://jazzband.co/donate)

This is very silly, but I literally install this package for one particular model mixin: [`TimeStampedModel`](https://django-model-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#timestampedmodel). I use it _everywhere_ -- basically any model that might be useful to know when it got last updated. Insanely useful for lightweight audit tracking of a model.

### [whitenoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/)

Stop messing with S3 buckets and the atrocious AWS console. `whitenoise` will set the correct cache headers on your static assets automagically and a CDN like Cloudflare or Fastly will serve your assets without ever hitting your Python app. Even without a CDN, an NGINX sidecar to serve static assets will greatly reduce the amount of load for your WSGI server.


## Server-side rendering

### [django-compressor](https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/)

Compress JavaScript or CSS for production with hashed filenames (which breaks the long-term cache when used with `whitenoise`). There are a lot of settings, but I just copy and paste the same configuration into every project now and it works perfectly. Pair it with [`django-libsass`](https://github.com/torchbox/django-libsass) to support SASS files without an extra build step.

### [django-widget-tweaks](https://github.com/jazzband/django-widget-tweaks) [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://jazzband.co/donate)

Very underrated in my opinion, `django-widget-tweaks` provides a few template tags to help render forms and fields in HTML. Usually when working with designers or more front-end folks, this allows them to customize HTML without touching Python or understanding the form rendering in Django.

### [django-allauth](https://docs.allauth.org/) [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/sponsors/pennersr/)

The premier authentication provider for integrating Django with third-party logins like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. The number of providers is staggering and always growing. [pennersr](https://github.com/pennersr) does a great job of handling the myriad support requests for such an integral part of the ecosystem.


## API

Django seems to be used just as an API and paired with a frontend framework frequently these days. There are some libraries that I have used to provide APIs in my Django projects.

### [django-ninja](https://django-ninja.dev) [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/djangoninja)

`django-rest-framework` is the 800-pound gorilla when building a REST framework with Django. It has lots of documentation and lots of supporters. Personally, I also find it a little cumbersome to use and grok. I have only used `django-ninja` for two projects, but I really enjoyed its approach, especially if you have ever used `FastAPI` or are a fan of Python typing. I hope it continues to evolve and provide an alternative to DRF.

### [strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/django) [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/sponsors/strawberry-graphql)

Similar to `django-ninja`, `strawberry` uses Python types to provide a GraphQL interface. I have also only used it for a few projects, but I was very happy with the developer experience (especially compared to Apollo).


## Background tasks

### [django-q2](https://django-q2.readthedocs.io/)

I have tried `celery`, `django-rq`, and `huey` and have always returned back to `django-q2` when I need a background task runner for long-running tasks. My favorite features are the integration with Django admin, the ability to use either `redis` or a database to store tasks, and a cron-like scheduler.
